                <h2>Veronica Bendixen</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Veronica, I have been passionate about software development since 11th grade in high school and took my first computer course. After finishing the class I knew what my college major would be. I learned 7 programming languages getting my AAS. Everyone knew I was a nerd when Assembler and SQL were my top favorites. After getting my BS and working in corporate America I am currently enrolled in the Code:You bootcamp to expand my horizons.</p>
